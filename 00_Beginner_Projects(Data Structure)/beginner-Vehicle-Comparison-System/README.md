 # Vehicle Comparison System
 
###  ðŸš— Theme: "Manage a fleet of vehicles and sort them"

Students will create a Vehicle class, sort vehicles naturally by year (newest first) and by brand name alphabetically using a custom comparator.
They will print the vehicles nicely using `forEach(System.out::println)`, and test sorting with JUnit 5.
