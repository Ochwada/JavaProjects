## üìù Assignment: **Logging / Audit Trail Writer (Simulation)**

### üéØ **Problem Background**

In real-world applications ‚Äî especially in **banking**, **healthcare**, or **e-commerce** ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential to keep an **audit trail** of critical actions. Each time a user performs an action (like transferring money or accessing sensitive data), we need to log that event asynchronously, so we don‚Äôt slow down the main system flow.

> ‚ùó Logs must be recorded in real-time but should **not block** the main user operations.

We‚Äôll simulate an **audit logging system** using Java threads. Each "user action" will trigger a log entry, and we‚Äôll handle the logging asynchronously using threads.

## üß† **Algorithmic Thinking & Design Discussion**

Help students break it down:

| Task              | What to Think About                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Action simulation | How do we simulate a user event like "Login" or "Transfer"?            |
| Logging           | How can we log messages in real-time without blocking the main thread? |
| Thread use        | Should logging be in the same thread? (No ‚Äì it must be separate.)      |
| Logging queue     | What happens if multiple actions are triggered at once?                |
| Output            | Where do we log? For this simulation: print to console.                |

## üîÑ Steps to Follow

1. **Create an `AuditLogger` class** that implements `Runnable`.
2. Accept a log message and simulate writing the log (with `Thread.sleep()`).
3. In the main app, simulate multiple user actions.
4. For each action, create a new thread for logging.
5. Use `join()` so main thread waits for logs to complete (optional for realism).
6. Document the theory with `JavaDoc`.

## üíª Starter Code with TODOs

### üîß `AuditLogger.java`

```java
// TODO: Declare the package 'com.example.audit'

/**
 * The AuditLogger class is a task that simulates writing a log entry
 * asynchronously. It implements Runnable so it can be executed by a Thread.
 *
 * Threads are ideal here because we want to simulate concurrent logging 
 * without blocking the main execution flow.
 */

// TODO: Define a public class named 'AuditLogger' that implements the 'Runnable' interface

// TODO: Declare a private final field 'message' of type String to store the log message
 /**
     * Constructs an AuditLogger with the log message.
     *
     * @param message The audit message to be logged.
     */
// TODO: Create a constructor that accepts a String message and assigns it to the message field

 /**
     * The run method contains the logic for logging.
     * We simulate a delay using Thread.sleep() to mimic real-world logging latency.
     */
// TODO: Override the 'run' method from Runnable interface. This is where logging logic will go.

    // TODO: Inside 'run', print a message that logging has started. Include the current thread's name and the log message.

    // TODO: Use Thread.sleep() to simulate a delay in logging (1000 milliseconds)

    // TODO: Catch the InterruptedException that might occur during sleep
        // TODO: Print an error message indicating the logging was interrupted
        // TODO: Reset the thread's interrupted status using Thread.currentThread().interrupt()

    // TODO: After the delay, print a message that logging has finished. Again, include the thread name and the message.

```

### üöÄ `AuditSimulationApp.java`

```java
// TODO: Declare the package 'com.example.audit'

// TODO: Import required classes from java.util for working with Lists and Arrays

/**
 * Main class to simulate audit trail logging using threads.
 *
 * Theory:
 * In real systems, audit logs are often handled by a logging framework
 * or background thread to avoid blocking user-facing processes.
 */
// TODO: Define a public class named 'AuditSimulationApp' ‚Äî this will be the main entry point

    // TODO: Define the main method ‚Äî this is where the simulation starts

        // TODO: Create a List of Strings to represent simulated user actions or audit log messages

        // TODO: Loop through each action in the list
            // TODO: For each action, create an instance of AuditLogger with the action as the message
            // TODO: Create a new Thread using the AuditLogger instance and give it a unique name using hashCode
            // TODO: Start the thread to simulate asynchronous logging

            // OPTIONAL TODO: Use join() to wait for the thread to finish (uncomment block to enable)
                // TODO: Wrap join in try-catch for InterruptedException
                // TODO: If interrupted, print error and reset thread's interrupt flag

        // TODO: After the loop, print a message indicating that all audit log threads have been started

```

## üìö Java Concepts Used

| Concept        | Why It‚Äôs Used                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Runnable`     | Clean way to define logging as a task        |
| `Thread`       | Executes each logging task asynchronously    |
| `sleep()`      | Simulates I/O delay during logging           |
| `join()`       | Optional use to wait for logging threads     |
| `List<String>` | Simulates user actions triggering log events |
