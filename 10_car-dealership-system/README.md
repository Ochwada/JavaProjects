# ðŸ“˜ **Assignment: Mastering Instance and Static Variables in Java**

---

## ðŸ§± **ðŸ§  Background**

In this assignment, youâ€™ll design a mini Java project to **simulate a car dealership system**. Youâ€™ll be practicing how to manage:

- ðŸ”¹ **Instance variables**: data unique to each car (like brand, model, price)
- ðŸ”¹ **Static variables**: data shared across all cars (like dealership name or counters)
- ðŸ”¹ **Static methods and blocks**
- ðŸ”¹ Object memory concepts and class structure

By completing this exercise, you'll solidify your understanding of **object-oriented design**, and learn when and why to use static vs instance variables.

## âœ… **Assignment Tasks**

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 1: Define the `Car` class with Instance Variables**

> ðŸŽ¯ Create a `Car` class with instance variables: `brand`, `model`, `year`, and `price`.

- Use a constructor to initialize all fields.
- Add a `displayInfo()` method to print details of a car.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 2: Create Car Objects in `DealershipApp`**

> ðŸŽ¯ Create at least 3 `Car` objects with different data in the main app, and print their info.

- Observe how each object has **its own state** (brand, model, etc.).

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 3: Add Static Variable for Dealer Name**

> ðŸŽ¯ Add a static variable `dealerName` in the `Car` class. Initialize it with `"Global Motors"`.

- Print the dealer name in the `displayInfo()` method.
- Change it from the main method and print it again from multiple objects.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 4: Track Total Cars Created with Static Counter**

> ðŸŽ¯ Add a static variable `totalCarsCreated` that increments in the constructor.

- Add a static method `getTotalCarsCreated()` and print the total after creating several cars.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 5: Add Static Block to Initialize Dealer**

> ðŸŽ¯ Use a static block to initialize `dealerName` and print a message when it runs.

- Demonstrate how it executes **only once** when the class is loaded.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 6: Modify Car Price Using Instance Method**

> ðŸŽ¯ Add a method `setPrice(double newPrice)` that updates the price if itâ€™s greater than zero.

- Use this method in the main class to simulate a price update.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 7: Add Discount Feature**

> ðŸŽ¯ Add a method `applyDiscount(double percent)` to reduce price based on percentage.

- Example: 10% discount on $20,000 â†’ new price = $18,000.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 8: Add Depreciation Calculation**

> ðŸŽ¯ Add a method `depreciate(int currentYear)` that decreases the price by 10% for every year of age.

- Calculate how old the car is and apply the depreciation.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 9: Create `DealerStats` Utility Class with Static Methods**

> ðŸŽ¯ Create a class `DealerStats` with static methods like `printWelcomeMessage()` and `printSummary()`.

- This class should not require instantiation.
- Show how static methods can be accessed without an object.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Task 10: Advanced â€“ Change Dealer Name via Static Method**

> ðŸŽ¯ Add a static method `setDealerName(String name)` in the `Car` class to update the dealer name.

- Show that changing it updates the value for all existing objects.
