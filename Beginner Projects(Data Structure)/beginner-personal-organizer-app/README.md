# ðŸŽ¯ **Assignment: Personal Organizer App (with `ArrayList`)**  
### ðŸ“… Theme: Organize your life â€“ one dynamic list at a time!

In this assignment, youâ€™ll build various modules of a **Personal Organizer** application using Java's `ArrayList`. Each task focuses on solving a real-world use case that benefits from the **flexibility**, **efficiency**, and **functionality** of `ArrayList`.

This assignment is broken down into **10 mini-tasks**. Complete each one and commit your progress to GitHub.

## âœ… Task 1: To-Do List Manager

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Build a to-do list that can add, remove, and print tasks.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Fast random access for displaying tasks.
- Dynamic size (unlike arrays).
- Insertion/deletion isnâ€™t heavy at the end â€“ fits common task management behavior.

---

## âœ… Task 2: Shopping List App

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Users can add items to their shopping list, check for duplicates, and remove purchased items.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Allows duplicates (e.g., 2 "Milk").
- Easy to display by index (with quantities).
- Simpler than `LinkedList` for shopping-style flows where most additions/removals are at the end.

---

## âœ… Task 3: Bookmarks Manager

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Users can save URLs, display the full list, and open any by index.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Random access is needed to pick a bookmark quickly.
- `LinkedList` would be too slow for index-based access.
- Arrays can't dynamically grow as users add bookmarks.

---

## âœ… Task 4: Contact Search

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Users can store contacts and search by name using a partial match.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Fast iteration and flexible storage.
- Better than arrays (fixed size).
- No need for `LinkedList` here since insertions/removals arenâ€™t frequent.

---

## âœ… Task 5: Wishlist Sorter

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Users maintain a wishlist of products and can sort it alphabetically or by priority.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Can easily be sorted using `Collections.sort()`.
- Arrays donâ€™t allow easy sorting of growing data.
- `LinkedList` doesnâ€™t perform as well with sorting algorithms.

---

## âœ… Task 6: Daily Planner (Time Slots)

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Plan your day using a list of time slots, each holding a short task.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Each time slot has a fixed position (like 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM...).
- Perfect use case for indexed access.
- `LinkedList` is inefficient for access by position.

---

## âœ… Task 7: Quick Notes App

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Users can quickly jot down and delete notes.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Simple, dynamic, and readable.
- Notes are often accessed or removed by index or content.
- Arrays canâ€™t grow, and `LinkedList` adds unnecessary overhead.

---

## âœ… Task 8: Tag Manager

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Allow users to tag things with keywords and print all current tags.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Great for dynamic and iterative tag collections.
- Allows duplicates (if needed), and ordering matters.
- Arrays are too rigid for casual user-generated content.

---

## âœ… Task 9: Reminder System

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Add reminders for future events, then view and remove them when done.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- Dynamic list makes it easy to update.
- You donâ€™t need constant insertion/removal at the start (so no need for `LinkedList`).
- Ideal for appending and displaying.

---

## âœ… Task 10: Recently Watched Tracker

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Track a list of recently watched shows. Show the last 5 and remove the oldest when limit is reached.

ðŸ§  **Why `ArrayList`?**
- You can manually control the size and trim from the start (like a rolling buffer).
- Arrays canâ€™t shrink; `LinkedList` may make `get(i)` operations painful.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

Each task should include:
- A Java class (one per task).
- A main method for demo.
- A few test cases or console output samples.
- Clear variable naming and comments.

---

## ðŸ§ª Bonus Challenge Ideas
ðŸ’¥ Add file storage (save/load list items)  
ðŸ’¥ Use `Collections.sort()` and `Collections.reverse()`  
ðŸ’¥ Implement duplicate checking where it makes sense

---

## ðŸš€ Submission
1. Clone the GitHub Classroom repo.
2. Complete the 10 Java classes.
3. Push your code with proper commit messages.
4. Submit your link before the deadline ðŸŽ¯
